This repository contains helper methods that support building rules that
target Apple platforms. See [the
docs](https://github.com/bazelbuild/apple_support/tree/master/doc) for
how you can use these helpers. Also see
[rules_apple](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple) and
[rules_swift](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_swift) for more Apple
platform rules.
